# SPUD

SPUD is a daemon written in PHP that is executed by requesting the file via HTTP, once run the daemon can be accessed by a user by connecting to the IP address of the server on the port the daemon is running on in a program such as netcat.

SPUD provides the client with a small shell that can be used to invoke system commands and, in the future, hopefully a non-canonical text editor and other such things.
